# my-work-day-scheduler

This is my work day scheduler that allows me to store events, by the hour, for a single day. Time blocks from 9AM - 5PM are dynamically created in 9 rows that will allow a write-up for each block to be stored in local cache when the respective save button is clicked. Text data for events persist upon web page reload/refresh. Additionally row coloring is applied to indicate gray for the past, red for the present, and green for the future.
